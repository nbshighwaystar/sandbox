* Never store password in plain text
    - Compromises users on your site
    - Compromises users on other sites

    - Same inputs + same hasing algorith = same output
    - Actual password gets encrypted, then stored
    -Attempted password gets encrypted, compared against stored


* Hashing algorithms suitable for passwords
    - MD5
    - SHA-1
    - SHA-2 (SHA256, SHA-512)
    - Whirlpool, Tiger, AES
    - Blowfish
